# [Django Apps](https://appseed.us/apps/django/)

[Django Apps](https://appseed.us/apps/django/) crafted with authentication, database, ORM, modular codebase and deployment scripts - Actively Supported by AppSeed. For newcomers, **Django** is a high-level, open-source web framework written in Python that enables developers to build web applications quickly and with a clean, pragmatic design. 

In [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), an "app" (short for application) is a self-contained module or component of a web application that encapsulates a specific functionality or set of related features.

Django encourages developers to structure their projects by breaking them down into multiple apps, each responsible for a particular aspect of the application. Django Apps are designed to be reusable, making it easier to develop complex web applications with modular and maintainable code.
